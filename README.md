# Business Application Development Final
### University of Washington IS 320 Final Project - June 2020

This is my submission for my final project for the business application development class I took at UW's Foster School of Business.

This is a program that accepts input from the user pertaining to a fictional book order. The program stores the inputted information in dictionaries and returns the total price
of the order, its shipping cost, and the number of books in the order. The program can also read input from a text file and write the relevant business statistics to a new text file
named by the user.

Inputs: Name, number of books ordered, prime and express status. 

Outputs: Average revenue, total price, shipping cost, order counts, data stored in dictionaries.
